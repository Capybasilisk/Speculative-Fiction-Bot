This is a Reddit bot that continually scans comments across the entire site for mentions of science fiction and 
fantasy books. If an SF/F book title is detected, the bot checks if the author's name is also present in the comment. 

If both these conditions are met, the bot searches YouTube for an audiobook of the mentioned title, then replies
with a link to it should one be found.

The bot uses a dataset with title/author info scraped from the Internet Speculative Fiction Database, a compendium
of all known science fiction and fantasy literary works. 

The scraping code and full dataset are also included in this repo.
